# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements for the web scraper development.

## Web Scraping Approach

The primary method for web scraping will involve using a headless browser controlled by **Selenium**. This approach is necessary for the following reasons:

*   **Dynamic Content:** The target website, the Connecticut Judiciary's civil inquiry site, likely uses JavaScript to load data and render content dynamically. A simple HTTP request library like `requests` would not be able to access this content. Selenium allows us to automate a real web browser, which will execute the necessary JavaScript to display the full page content.
*   **User Interactions:** The scraping process may require simulating user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms (e.g., selecting a town), and navigating through pagination. Selenium provides the functionality to perform these actions.

## Python Packages

The following Python packages are required for this project:

| Package         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selenium`      | The core library for browser automation. It will be used to control the web browser, navigate to the target URLs, and interact with web elements.                  |
| `beautifulsoup4`| A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. While Selenium can extract information from web pages, BeautifulSoup provides a more convenient and powerful API for navigating the HTML DOM and extracting specific data. |
| `requests`      | Although the primary scraping will be done with Selenium, the `requests` library may be used for simpler, static requests if any are identified. It is also a good practice to have it available for general HTTP requests. |
| `webdriver-manager` | This package will automatically manage the browser driver for selenium.                                                                                                                                                           |

## APIs and URLs

*   **Target URL:** https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/PropertyAddressSearch.aspx";
*   **Initial Data Extraction:** The first step will be to scrape this URL to obtain a list of court cases and their corresponding docket numbers for a specific town.
*   **Key HTML Tags (Anticipated):**
    *   `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`: For extracting tabular data containing case information.
    *   `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<option>`: For interacting with the town selection form.
    *   `<a>`: For extracting links to individual case details.

## Development Environment

*   **Python Version:** 3.8 or higher
*   **Virtual Environment:** It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
*   **Browser Driver:** A compatible web browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) will be required for Selenium to control the browser. The `webdriver-manager` package will handle this automatically.
