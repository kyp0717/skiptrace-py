# Phase 5b Log

## Date: 2025-08-27

### Summary

In this phase, I tested the HTTP POST request to the sandbox Batch API. I created a new test file `tests/test_batch_api_connector.py` which contains the `TestBatchAPIConnector` class. This class has a method `test_send_skip_trace_request` that sends a POST request to the sandbox URL with a test address and asserts that the response is not None. The test was run in a virtual environment using `uv` and it passed successfully.
