# Phase 5 Re-implementation Log

## Date: 2025-08-27

### Summary

In this phase, I re-implemented Phase 5 of the project based on the updated project plan.

**Phase 5a:**

*   Modified `src/batch_api_connector.py` to read the API token from `batchapi.csv`.
*   The `BatchAPIConnector` class now takes an environment parameter (`sandbox` or `prod`) to determine which API token to use.

**Phase 5b:**

*   Created a new test file `tests/test_batch_api_connector.py`.
*   The test now reads test cases from `tests/batchapi_test_cases.json`.
*   The test prints the input and output of each test case to the console.
*   The tests were run successfully.

### Summary

*   **Phase 5a:** Modified `src/batch_api_connector.py` to return a list of phone numbers from the API response.
*   **Phase 5b:** Modified `tests/test_batch_api_connector.py` to assert that the returned value is a list of strings (phone numbers). The test passed successfully.
