# Phase Re-implementation Summary
**Date:** 2025-08-28

## Overview
Successfully re-implemented project phases based on updated project plan specifications, focusing on proper test formatting, integration implementation, and production API support.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 4 Updates - Web Scraping
1. **Feature Test Enhancement**
   - Updated `tests/test_case_scraper.py` with colored terminal output (green for success, red for failure)
   - Added proper "FEATURE TEST" heading format as specified in project plan
   - Implemented proper error handling with try/catch blocks

2. **Integration Implementation**  
   - Created `main.py` as the main application entry point
   - Integrated case scraping functionality from `src/case_scraper.py`
   - Added command-line argument parsing for town name
   - Implemented JSON output file generation with scraped case data

3. **Integration Test**
   - Created `tests/test_phase4_integration.py`
   - Tests main.py execution with proper validation
   - Includes colored output and "INTEGRATION TEST" heading format

### Phase 5 Updates - Sandbox Batch API
1. **Integration Implementation**
   - Extended `main.py` to support batch API phone lookup
   - Added `--skip-trace` command-line flag to enable phone lookup
   - Integrated `src/batch_api_connector.py` for sandbox API calls
   - Processes first 2 addresses as per requirements

2. **Integration Test**
   - Created `tests/test_phase5_integration.py`
   - Validates sandbox API integration through main.py
   - Checks for phone number enrichment in output

### Phase 6 - Production Batch API (New)
1. **Implementation**
   - Extended `main.py` to support production API with `--prod` flag
   - Dynamically switches between sandbox and production environments
   - Maintains 2-address limit for production API testing

2. **Feature Test**
   - Created `tests/test_phase6_prod_api.py`
   - Direct testing of production API with real addresses from case scraper
   - Includes proper result validation and colored output

3. **Integration Test**
   - Created `tests/test_phase6_integration.py`
   - Tests full integration with production API through main.py
   - Validates proper API environment selection and execution

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
- `main.py` - Main application with full integration
- `tests/test_phase4_integration.py` - Phase 4 integration test
- `tests/test_phase5_integration.py` - Phase 5 integration test
- `tests/test_phase6_prod_api.py` - Phase 6 feature test
- `tests/test_phase6_integration.py` - Phase 6 integration test

### Modified Files
- `tests/test_case_scraper.py` - Added colored output and proper formatting
- `prps/tasks.md` - Updated with completed tasks

## Technical Improvements
1. Proper test output formatting with ANSI color codes
2. Clear separation between feature tests and integration tests
3. Consistent error handling across all test files
4. Command-line interface with flexible options
5. Environment-aware API connector (sandbox vs production)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic case scraping
python main.py Middletown

# With sandbox API phone lookup
python main.py Middletown --skip-trace

# With production API phone lookup
python main.py Middletown --skip-trace --prod
```

## Testing Coverage
- Phase 4: Web scraping with proper display formatting ✅
- Phase 5: Sandbox API integration ✅
- Phase 6: Production API integration ✅
- All tests include colored success/failure indicators
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality

## Status
All requested changes from the updated project plan have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.
