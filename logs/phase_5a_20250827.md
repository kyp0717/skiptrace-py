# Phase 5a Log

## Date: 2025-08-27

### Summary

In this phase, I implemented the HTTP POST request to the sandbox Batch API. I created a new file `src/batch_api_connector.py` which contains the `BatchAPIConnector` class. This class has a method `send_skip_trace_request` that sends a POST request to the sandbox URL with the address and returns the JSON response.
